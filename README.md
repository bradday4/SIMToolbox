### Developer version of SIMToolbox

SIMToolbox IS an open-source, modular set of functions for MATLAB designed for processing data acquired by structured illumination microscopy. Both optical sectioning and super-resolution applications are supported. The software is also capable of maximum a posteriori probability image estimation (MAP-SIM), an alternative method for reconstruction of structured illumination images. MAP-SIM can potentially reduce reconstruction artifacts, which commonly occur due to refractive index mismatch within the sample and to imperfections in the illumination.
